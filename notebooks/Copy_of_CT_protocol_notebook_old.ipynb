        "Use the inputs to expertly decided on the appropriate protocol for the CT study.  the additional context is given in the text below, which describes each of the CT protocols, which are the outputs. For scans in which the order does not match the desired protocol, or if there are other outstanding questions the radiologist needs to resolve (e.g., elevated contrast above 2.0 mg/dL or  history of severe allergic reaction to IV contrast such as trouble breathing, throat swelling, or anaphylaxis, and contrast enhanced scan ordered), then add a comment that will route the case back to the radiologist (comments should be from one of the following: 'elevated creatinine', 'contrast should be given but not ordered', 'severe allergy', 'steroid prep required', 'protocol order mismatch', 'pelvis excluded', 'complexity'). In addition to the protocol descriptions, note some rules: 1. cannot add contrast if it was not ordered--if deemed necessary by the protocol, the study would have to be routed for a conversation with the ordering provider to see if they would like to add contrast (and patient has no known contraindications such as severe allergy or elevated creatinine). 2. Cannot add a body part--if a scan is of the abdomen only, cannot add the pelvis or the chest. For some malignancies, such as esophageal or lung, it is not uncommon to scan the chest and abdomen but not the pelvis, and those cases should not be re-routed. If there were suspicious findings in the pelvis on the prior, or for other types of malignancies that require the pelvis (colon or rectal cancer, ovarian, breast, etc) then those cases should be routed back with a cement. 3. For mild to moderate contrast reactions in the allergy history, can premedicate the patient with steroids (a steroid prep) prior to the scan; this will need to be communicated via comment. 4. It is okay to over-image, but ideally no simpler protocols for studies that require multiphase imaging. 5. Any acute hemorrhage is ideally scanned by the GI bleed protocol (CT with and without contrast, with arterial and venous phases). 6. Any study specifically ordered to evaluate the chest only (such as a PE study), or the thoracic-abdominal aorta or leg arteries should be routed to the chest/cardiovascular imaging division. 7. If there is an indeterminate renal or adrenal mass on the prior study, it can be evaluated by adding pre contrast images through the abdomen in addition to the regular protocol (comment: 'precontrast through kidneys or adrenals'). That can be added on without communicating with the ordering provider.\n",
        "Here is a description of the protocols: Abdomen/Pelvis (AP):  Routine protocol for most patients includes portal venous phase imaging.  No oral contrast is administered by default, but can be specified as an addition (AP with IV, oral) and must then be ordered via CPOE (inpatients) or by paper order (outpatients). Coronal reformations are included.\n",
        "\n",
        "Routine (routine):  Protocol for most patients includes portal venous phase imaging.  No oral contrast is administered by default, but can be added through comments.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Low Pelvis (in conjunction with AP or CAP, designated APlow or CAPlow):  Extends the caudal range of an otherwise routine protocol CT for malignancies that may not be fully imaged on our routine protocols. This includes vulvar cancer, anal cancer, and perhaps rectal cancer if this is the first time evaluation or there is known recurrent disease low in the pelvis.  Perirectal abscess or perianal fistulous disease may be other possible indications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dual Liver Protocol (dual liver):  Known or suspected hypervascular liver tumor or suspected metastases from a primary tumor outside the liver for which there are suspected hypervascular liver metastases.  It includes an acquisition in both the hepatic arterial and portal venous phases.  Currently the list of malignancies for this protocol includes patients with neuroendocrine, carcinoid, and thyroid carcinoma.  Breast cancer and melanoma patients had been typically scanned with this protocol prior to July 2010, and if the patient has known lesions only seen on arterial phase images the patient may benefit from this protocol, but generally these malignancies can be evaluated with our routine CAP protocol. Coronal images of the portal venous phase are included (as are MIPs of the chest, if the chest is also ordered).\n",
        "\n",
        "Cirrhosis Protocol (cirrhosis):  Known or suspected cirrhosis and/or have a known or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma.  It also should be performed in all patients with suspected benign primary liver tumors, such as focal nodular hyperplasia or hepatic adenoma.  This protocol includes acquisitions in the hepatic arterial and the portal venous phases, as well as a delayed phase.  This protocol calls for a larger volume of contrast material and a higher infusion rate than the Dual Liver Protocol.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hepatic Resection Protocol (hepatic resection):  Indicated in all patients anticipating hepatic resection.  It includes thin section images of the liver to include celiac axis and proximal SMA during the hepatic arterial phase and thicker sections through the liver during the portal venous phase.  The images obtained during the hepatic arterial phase undergo volume rendering in 3D.\n",
        "\n",
        "Radioembolization Protocol (radioembo):  Typically ordered by the Interventional Radiologists for evaluation of a patient following (and possibly before) embolization therapy. This includes arterial and venous phases through the abdomen. The post processing is slightly different than the cirrhosis protocol in that thin images are sent in both arterial and portal venous phases for the 3D lab to assess the vasculature and liver volumes. It should be specifically mentioned in the order, otherwise do not use the protocol.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pancreas Protocol (pancreas):  Known or suspected pancreatic tumor.  It is occasionally requested in patients with either acute or chronic pancreatitis.  It includes thin section images of the pancreas to include the celiac axis and SMA during the pancreatic phase and images of the liver and pancreas during the venous phase.  Arterial phase images are reconstructed in 3D. Coronal images of the portal venous phase are included. Unless otherwise specified, imaging is of the abdomen only.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cholangiocarcinoma Protocol (cholangiocarcinoma):  Known or suspected cholangiocarcinoma.  It includes images of the liver in the portal venous phase as well as through the hilum following a 10 minute delay.  Coronal reformats of the venous phase are included.\n",
        "\n",
        "Trauma Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis (trauma):  Suspected trauma. Arterial phase imaging through the upper and mid chest followed by portal venous phase imaging of the abdomen and pelvis.  No oral contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations of the spine are generated as a separate study interpreted by the MSK section.\n",
        "\n",
        "Crohns Protocol (crohns):  Evaluation to look for suspected Crohns involvement, but not necessarily for complications of Crohn’s.  If a relatively asymptomatic patient, the patient receives VolumenTM (a negative contrast agent). Enteric arterial phase images of the abdomen and pelvis are acquired, and sagittal and coronal reformats are also included. Similar to other Bowel Protocol except that only a single phase is acquired to minimize radiation dose.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Valsalva Protocol:  Known or suspected abdominal wall hernia.  The patient receives IV and oral contrast.  A portal venous phase scan of the abdomen and pelvis is obtained while the patient is instructed to perform the Valsalva maneuver. Coronal reformats are included.\n",
        "\n",
        "#CT Colonography:  For colon cancer and polyp screening.  The patient undergoes bowel prep the night before the scan as well as barium tagging.  Insufflation of CO2 via device after placement of tube into rectum.  Supine and prone imaging, as well as decubitus position if nondistended segments on the two standard positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Renal Stone Protocol (renal stone):  Acute flank pain and/or a known or suspected renal calculus.  It includes a low dose noncontrast CT of the kidneys, ureters and bladders with the patient in prone position (unless unable).  Coronal reformats are provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "Genitourinary Protocol (gu):  Hematuria, known or suspected renal mass, or other indications where evaluation of the ureters is necessary.  It includes low dose non-contrast images of the kidneys only followed by nephrographic phase images of the kidneys and 7 min delayed excretory phase images of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder.  Coronal reformats of the excretory phase are included.\n",
        "\n",
        "Focused Renal Cyst Protocol (focused renal cyst): For followup of a complicated renal cyst. Pre- and Post-contrast (Nephrographic) imaging through the kidneys to assess for enhancement. There is no imaging of the pelvis and no CT urogram. If in doubt, use the more complete GU Protocol.\n",
        "\n",
        "RCC Protocol (rcc):  Known renal cell carcinoma, typically in patients who have undergone a nephrectomy or nephron sparing treatment, or possibly for preoperative planning.  It includes noncontrast images of the kidneys followed by a dual liver as described above to assess for metastases.  Coronal reformats in the venous phase are included.\n",
        "\n",
        "TCC Protocol (tcc):  Intended for patients with known transitional cell carcinoma, typically who have undergone a cystectomy.  It is a split bolus technique, with the goal of imaging the patient in both the excretory phase and the portal venous phase in a single acquisition following two boluses of IV contrast prior to scanning.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Renal Donor Protocol:  To evaluate the renal anatomy of potential renal donors.  This includes thin section images of the kidneys and renal arteries during the arterial phase and venous phase.  A delayed scout is obtained to document the number of ureters.  A separate 3-D interpretation is performed.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Adrenal Protocol:  5tt555For the evaluation of an indeterminate adrenal mass.  Noncontrast images through the adrenal gland.  The scan is then checked by a physician for further imaging.  If the physician deems necessary, portal venous and 15 minute delayed images through the adrenals follow.\n",
        "\n",
        "CT Cystogram (cystogram):  To evaluate for bladder injury (typically after pelvic trauma) or a fistula.  Contrast (Renografin 60 diluted in saline) is instilled by gravity through an indwelling Foley catheter.\n",
