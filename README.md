# Automated Abdominal CT Protocoling Using Fine-Tuned LLM
#aipi590 project 1 

This project fine tunes a Mistral 7B Instruct model to protocol CT scans. 

## Background
Performing the appropriate type of abdominal CT scan is important to high quality clinical care. The decisions of whether or not to use enteric contrast or IV contrast and the timing (phases) of imaging relative to IV contrast administration are encapsulated into specific protocols, which serve as recipes for performing the CT scan. Typically, this is performed entirely or in part by an individual, often a physician, and can be a time-intensive process given the large number of CT orders and occasionally vague statements of the indication for the examination. Automation of this process would allow the radiologist to focus time on other clinical duties such as interpreting scans. Large Language Models, which have shown a large number of
